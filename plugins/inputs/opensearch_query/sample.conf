  ## Multiple urls can be specified as part of the same cluster,
  ## this means that only ONE of the urls will be written to each interval.

  ## OpenSearch client timeout, defaults to "5s".
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## HTTP basic authentication details
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "admin"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification

    ## The date/time field in the OpenSearch index (mandatory).
    date_field = "@timestamp"

    ## If the field used for the date/time field in OpenSearch is also using
    ## a custom date/time format it may be required to provide the format to
    ## correctly parse the field.

    ## If using one of the built in OpenSearch formats this is not required.

    ## Normally should be set to same as collection interval

    ## Fields to aggregate values (must be numeric fields)
    # metric_fields = ["metric"]

    ## Aggregation function to use on the metric fields
    ## Must be set if 'metric_fields' is set
    ## Valid values are: avg, sum, min, max, sum
    # metric_function = "avg"

    ## Fields to be used as tags
    ## Must be text, non-analyzed fields. Metric aggregations are performed
    ## per tag
    # tags = ["field.keyword", "field2.keyword"]

    ## Set to true to not ignore documents when the tag(s) above are missing
    # include_missing_tag = false

    ## String value of the tag when the tag does not exist
    ## Used when include_missing_tag is true
    # missing_tag_value = "null"
